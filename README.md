**I am** the creator and maintainer of [SysIdentPy](https://sysidentpy.org/), a Python Package For System Identification and Timeseries Forecasting Using NARMAX Models. I'm also the author of the open soure book [Nonlinear System Identification and Forecasting: Theory and Practice With SysIdentPy](https://sysidentpy.org/book/0%20-%20Preface/) and as a free time hobby I like to play videogame and play guitar.
